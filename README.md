## **Overview**
**BankBot** is an AI-powered chatbot built to assist bank customers with **credit card inquiries** and **credit card management**. By leveraging **Firebase**, **Vertex AI**, and **Dialogflow CX**, the bot provides users with a seamless experience for managing their credit cards. The frontend is developed using **JavaScript**, ensuring smooth and intuitive user interactions.

## **Features**
- **Mobile app integration** to offer a unified banking experience.
- Get help choosing the **right credit card** for your needs
- Tell about your current situation and get **personalized credit card recommendations**, or help by getting reminders of the insurances you have
- Get up-to-date **interest rate information**
- Increase your credit limit or **apply for a new credit card**
- Instantly **block a credit card** in case of emergency

## **How it Works**
- **Dialogflow CX** is the backbone of the chatbot's conversational structure, with clearly defined **intents**, **entities**, and **response flows** tailored for banking queries.
- **Vertex AI** and **Firebase** power the natural language understanding and backend services, providing intelligent, context-aware responses to customer inquiries.
- The **JavaScript frontend** acts as the user interface, capturing input and dynamically rendering the chatbot's replies, ensuring a responsive user experience.

## **Deployment**
**BankBot** is deployed on **Firebase** and is accessible through the following link: [Try BankBot](https://lcl-hackathon-e12-sbox-92e5.web.app/).

The following improvements are planned for future iterations:
- Ability to login and access **personalized account information** thanks to a database that has already been set up on BigQuery.
- Expansion to cover additional **banking services** like loans and savings accounts.
- Enhanced AI capabilities to handle more **complex banking queries** and provide personalized assistance.
